# Plunes - Case Study for Electricity Board 

Created a web application for itâ€™s staff
with capability to view and edit the connections made/requested by the user.
It is a Multi-Page User Interface to keep track of applied connections and
their status.
The application covers the following aspects--:

### PART A
1. Display the records in a grid or tabular format.
2. Search option to look for connection details with Applicant ID.
3. Add a date picker to filter via date range via date of application.
4. Option to view/edit electricity connection application requests.
a. Refer dataset for the data attributes.
b. Could be on same or different page.
5. Data Validation.
a. Should not be allowed to change the Date of Application, Govt ID Type, and ID Number.
b. Load applied should not exceed 200 KV.

### PART B
1. Create a visualization graph e.g., bar or line chart for number of connection requests in every month.
The user should be given flexibility to select status (pending, approved etc.) of choice. (Use some form of
charting library).
